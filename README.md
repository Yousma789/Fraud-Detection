Fraud Detection System

🚀 Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning 🔍💳

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a fraud detection system using the Credit Card Fraud Dataset. The system detects fraudulent transactions using machine learning models, addressing class imbalance and providing real-time predictions.

📊 Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles imbalanced data using SMOTE and scales features for accuracy.

Model Training: Implements Random Forest & Gradient Boosting for fraud detection.

Model Evaluation: Uses precision, recall, and F1-score for performance assessment.

User-Friendly Testing: Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for real-time fraud detection.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy 📊

Scikit-learn 🤖

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) ⚖️

Matplotlib, Seaborn 📈

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is Credit Card Fraud Dataset.

Ensure creditcard.csv is placed in the project directory before running the script.

🔧 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fraud-Detection-System.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Fraud-Detection-System

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the fraud detection script:

python fraud_detection.py

🎯 Usage

The CLI will prompt you to enter transaction details.

The model will predict whether the transaction is Fraudulent or Legitimate.

📌 Model Performance

The models were evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score
